# Data_Analysis
Created a Power BI interactive dashboard for the **Sales**, **Marketing**, **Finance** and **Supply Chain** of AtliQ Hardware.


Steps:

1) Extracted the data into MySQL and created a Database. Understood data of various tables and imported the Data into Power BI.
2) Further, performed ETL processes from MySQL Database. And made connections between the database tables using Power BI Model.
3) Formed "Measures" which I used in visualization.
4) Created multiple dashboards that gives insights in Finance, Sales, Marketing, and Supply chain processes of the company.
